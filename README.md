**Udacity Self Driving Car - Term 1 - Project 1 - Detect Lane Lines in images and video clips**

**Objective** : 

This project attempts to identify lane line(s) infront of a car, over a series of images and video clips.

**Pre-Requisite** : 

* Term1 - starter kit
https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/README.md

I followed the instructions for Docker image ( Mac ) because I preferred to have the same code easily deployable to CPU versus GPU, and Docker allows for that flexibility.

**Packages used for pipeline** : 

Once the above was installed I used the following packages to build the pipeline :
* MatPlotLib.
* NumPy.
* OpenCV.
* MoviePy.
* IPython.

**Key File(s) / Folder(s)** :

* 'Jai-SDC-Term1-Project1.ipynb' - The Jupyter notebook for the project with Python Code.
* 'writeup.md' - The write up with detailed explanation of the technique utilized.
*  test_images_output - contains the processed images from the 'test_images' folder after being processed by my pipeline
*  test_videos_output - contains the processed video from the 'test_videos' folder after being processed by my pipeline
